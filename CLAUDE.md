# CLAUDE.md — AuNP Speciation / UV-Vis broadening model

Context for AI coding sessions (Claude Code etc.). Read this first.

## The scientific problem
12 nm gold nanoparticles at ~4% polydispersity show a UV-Vis extinction peak
that is **much broader and more red-tailed** than an FDTD/Mie model accounting
only for the 4% size spread. Hypothesis (Prof. Dragnea's lab): in liquid the
particles form a reversible equilibrium of **monomers ⇌ dimers ⇌ trimers ⇌
multimers**; the UV-Vis is an ensemble/time-integrated snapshot, and plasmonic
coupling in the clusters adds red-shifted intensity. Supporting evidence: a
**temperature-dependent isosbestic point** in the measured spectra.

**Goal:** Monte-Carlo the cluster populations → compute a simulated ensemble
spectrum → compare to experiment → invert into a tool that reports nominal
size + size distribution (%) AND multimer fractions, to replace/augment TEM.
This reframes UV-Vis width as *polydispersity + speciation*, not size alone.

## Architecture (three layers)
- **Layer 1 — `equilibrium.py`**: monomer/dimer/trimer association with
  van 't Hoff K(T); produces temperature-dependent populations → isosbestic.
- **Layer 2 — optical forward model** (two selectable backends):
  - `dielectric.py`: gold ε(λ), Etchegoin analytic model + optional small-particle
    surface-scattering damping (`gold_epsilon_sized`, `size_damping_correction`).
    Per ref 18, the imaginary part (damping) dominates fit accuracy and tabulated
    thin-film constants (Yakubovsky 2017) generalize best for colloidal Au — swap
    those in for production. NOTE: at 12 nm the size-damping correction alone
    broadens the monomer FWHM ~79→117 nm, so speciation broadening must be judged
    against a monomer model that already includes it (else over-attribution).
  - `mie.py`: single-sphere Mie cross sections + dipole polarizability α from a₁
    (`size_correction=True` applies the damping correction).
  - `clusters.py`: **CDA backend** — coupled point-dipole dimer/trimer, orientation
    averaged. Fast; UNDER-couples at contact (lower bound).
  - `clusters_tmatrix.py`: **exact T-matrix backend** (MSTM/GMM via `treams`) —
    all multipoles, exact orientation average. Validated: reproduces Mie for a
    monomer to 1e-15; gives 1.6× (dimer) / 2.8× (trimer) more red-tail than CDA
    at gap 1 nm; converged by lmax≈8 (sub-0.5 nm gaps need more). Needs the
    `mstm-env` venv (numpy 1.26 / scipy 1.11). Select via
    `spectra.species_basis(..., backend="tmatrix")`.
  - `spectra.py`: polydispersity integration + population-weighted mixing;
    `backend=` chooses the optics engine.
- **Layer 3 — `fitting.py` (skeleton built)**: separable/variable-projection
  least squares. Nonlinear params (mean diameter, % polydispersity) set the
  species basis shapes; species mixing weights are profiled out by NNLS at each
  step; outer `least_squares` optimizes the nonlinear params. Returns per-param
  uncertainties + identifiability verdicts. `scripts/fit_demo.py` is a synthetic
  recovery self-test.
  **Key finding from the self-test (real, not a bug):** a *single* 12 nm
  spectrum robustly constrains the **aggregated (non-monomer) gold fraction**
  (verdict "ok") but only weakly constrains mean size, barely constrains
  polydispersity (matches Bilén ref 19), and cannot separate dimer from trimer
  (collinear red tails). → Break these degeneracies by (a) using absolute
  extinction + the A_spr/A_450 ratio (Haiss, ref 14) to pin size/concentration,
  and (b) a **global fit across the temperature series** (shared size/gap,
  T-dependent K's) exploiting the isosbestic constraint.
- **Layer 3 — `fit_global.py` (global multi-temperature fit, BUILT)**: jointly
  fits a T-series that shares one sample — common (diameter, polydispersity,
  gap), conserved gold, one global amplitude profiled out linearly, and van 't
  Hoff K(T) driving populations. `scripts/fit_global_demo.py` self-test
  (mostly-monomer synthetic series) recovers mean diameter ≈12.7 nm (vs 12),
  thermodynamics ΔH₂≈−27 (vs −25 kJ/mol), and the aggregated-gold-fraction-vs-T
  curve to within noise. Polydispersity stays unconstrained (flat direction,
  huge SD — real, matches Bilén). Monomer-vs-aggregated split is robust; dimer-
  vs-trimer is still weak even globally → resolve with the exact-backend trimer
  *peak shape* and/or a concentration series.

## Known limitations (important — do not silently trust magnitudes)
1. **CDA under-couples at near-contact** (use the T-matrix backend for magnitudes).
   One dipole per sphere omits higher multipoles that dominate for gap/D ≲ 0.1,
   so CDA red-tails are a **lower bound** (measured 1.6×/2.8× low for dimer/
   trimer). The exact backend (`clusters_tmatrix.py`, treams) is wired in; use
   MSTM (exact multisphere
   T-matrix; Python `treams`/`smuthi`, or Mackowski MSTM) — verified to match
   CDA for a monomer and in the weak-coupling limit. This is the top priority
   upgrade for Layer 2.
2. **Analytic gold dielectric** shifts the absolute peak ~5–10 nm (currently
   527 nm vs ~520 nm expected). Swap in tabulated J&C / Yakubovsky (ref 18).
   A size-damping correction exists (`gold_epsilon_sized`) but is NOT yet wired
   into the size-integral of `spectra.species_basis` (mie has `size_correction=`
   flag, default off) — wire it so each size in the polydispersity integral uses
   its own ε. Big effect: FWHM 79→117 nm at 12 nm.
3. **Cluster polydispersity** is applied approximately (size-scaled). Refine
   with per-size cluster runs if needed.
4. Cluster geometry set is minimal (dimer, linear/triangular trimer). Extend
   with more multimer motifs + a gap distribution.
5. Global fit currently uses CDA basis in the loop (fast). For quantitative
   results precompute a T-matrix basis on a (D, gap) grid and interpolate, so
   the exact optics enter the fit without the per-iteration treams cost.
6. **Wavelength range**: the Etchegoin dielectric is only validated ~400–1000 nm
   and real Cary spectra carry deep-UV interband absorption plus a 350 nm
   lamp-changeover artifact, so `io_data.load_series` trims to
   `wavelength_range=(420, 800)` by default (`fit_real.py`: `--range MIN MAX`).
   Residual caveat: `fitting.py`/`fit_global.py` still weight the kept range
   uniformly — no per-wavelength noise model.

## Conventions
- Units: lengths in nm, cross sections in nm². Wavelengths are vacuum λ₀.
- All optics done *in the medium*: size parameter/wavenumber use n_medium; the
  particle enters as relative index m = n_Au/n_medium.
- CDA and Mie are consistent for N=1 (regression-tested in `scripts/verify.py`).
- Keep everything dependency-light (numpy/scipy/matplotlib). Add `treams` when
  wiring MSTM.

## Entry points
Two interpreters: the **system** python for CDA/Mie/fits, and the **mstm-env**
venv for the exact T-matrix backend (treams needs numpy 1.26 / scipy 1.11).

- `python scripts/verify.py` — physics sanity checks.
- `python scripts/demo.py` — figs 1–4 (species, broadening, isosbestic, gap).
- `python scripts/fit_demo.py` — fig 5, single-spectrum inverse fit.
- `python scripts/fit_global_demo.py` — fig 7, global multi-temperature fit.
- `mstm-env/bin/python scripts/validate_mstm.py` — fig 6, exact-vs-CDA (needs venv).
  Recreate venv: `python -m venv mstm-env && mstm-env/bin/pip install
  "numpy==1.26.4" "scipy==1.11.4" treams matplotlib`.
- `mstm-env/bin/python scripts/build_tmatrix_basis.py` — precompute the exact
  T-matrix basis over a (diameter, gap) grid -> outputs/tmatrix_basis.npz (~5 min).
- `python scripts/make_example_data.py` — write data/example_series.csv (uses the
  cache if present, so the demo is optics-consistent).
- `python scripts/fit_real.py [file.csv]` — fig 8; load a real UV-Vis file and fit.
  Uses the cached EXACT optics if present (fast, no treams at fit time), else CDA.
  Validated: on the self-consistent example it recovers D=12.0 nm, ΔH₂=-25.4
  (vs -25), and the aggregated-vs-T curve to the third decimal.

## The cached-exact-optics pattern (important)
The exact T-matrix is too slow inside a fit loop, so build it ONCE on a grid
(`basis_cache.build_grid`, run in mstm-env) and interpolate at fit time
(`basis_cache.load_cache(...).species_fn`, pure numpy — runs in the SYSTEM env).
Pass that callable as `backend=` to `species_basis` / the fitters. Keep the
optics backend used to *fit* the same as any used to *simulate* test data — a
mismatch (CDA data vs exact fit) biases size & aggregation (demonstrated).

## Next steps (suggested order)
1. Wire tabulated J&C / Yakubovsky ε + the size-damping correction into the
   polydispersity integral; re-verify peak ~520 nm.
2. Precompute a T-matrix species basis on a (D, gap) grid; make the fits use the
   exact optics via interpolation (keep CDA as the fast surrogate).
3. Add the Haiss A_spr/A_450 ratio + absolute extinction to pin size &
   concentration (breaks the size/poly degeneracy the T-series leaves open).
4. Real-data driver: load experimental T-series → `fit_temperature_series`.
5. Validate against TEM-characterized samples + the temperature/isosbestic series.
6. Optional: NN surrogate trained on Layer-1+2 spectra for instant inference.
